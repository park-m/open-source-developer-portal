# About Dwolla

Dwolla is the ideal platform to move money. When using the Dwolla API your software platform can move money between any 2 bank accounts, verify bank accounts, and store funds on behalf of your users.

Our software platform is compatible with all banks in the United States. The developer documents are designed to support our development partners who are building on top of Dwolla's platform. Our API is a simple unified access point to connect with US banks and credit unions.

The Dwolla API developer portal lives here: https://developers.dwolla.com

# dwolla-devportal

Dwolla's next-generation developer portal.  This is a jekyll-based site that compiles down to a set of static assets which live on GitHub Pages. Dwolla's developer portal can be seen here - https://developers.dwolla.com/

Skeleton generated using [generator-jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb).

## Getting started

First things first.  This project requires Node.js >= 0.10, Ruby >= 1.9.  Make sure you have those installed.

Clone this repo.  Then, you'll want to install dependencies:

```
bundle install
npm install
```

To build and serve the site on localhost, do:

```
grunt serve
```

## Deploying

To deploy changes to the gh-pages branch, do:

```
grunt deploy
```

If you're trying to deploy changes to the actual Dwolla repo, you'll need to make sure you're allowed to.  Only Dwolla organization members can do this.

Otherwise, if you're deploying to your own repo, make sure you edit the `buildcontrol.dist.options.remote` to be the URL of your git repo.  You'll probably also want to edit `app/CNAME` to use your own CNAME.
